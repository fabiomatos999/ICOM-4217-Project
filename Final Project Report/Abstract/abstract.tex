\section*{Abstract}
Insulin is a lifesaving medication used by approximately 7.4 million Americans. Insulin is mainly used to control sugar levels in the blood for type 1 and type 2 diabetics. The bodies of diabetics fail to either produce insulin correctly or the cells in the body do not respond to insulin. However, the safe and guideline compliant storage of insulin is difficult to measure in large industrial settings. This document details an implementation of a micro-controller based design that ensures the safe storage of insulin in accordance with FDA guidelines. We were successfully able to create a design that uses an MSP430 microcontroller to verify that the storage temperature of insulin is between 2\textcelsius and 8\textcelsius. If the detected temperature does not meet a warning is sent vie Bluetooth indicating which temperature range the medication is being subjective too. This is significant because the long term storage of insulin can now be monitored on individual box basis. We anticipate our design could be used in large scale manufacturing facilities where the electrical grid is frail and unstable. This is to ensure verify weather temperature of the Insulin vials meets the FDA guidelins at all times.
