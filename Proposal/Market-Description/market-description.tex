\section{Market Description}
The market target of our system is the Fridge-tag® 2 L with a serial number of 51050000XXXX \cite{RefrigeratorTemperatureMonitoring}. This device is similar to the idea of our project, is a high precision temperature data logger but it focuses on the monitoring of sensitive vaccines and pharmaceuticals stored in medical refrigerators \& freezers. The Fridge-tag 2 L automatically triggers an alarm when a critical temperature deviation out of the predefined temperature range is measured. This enables to react just in time and avoid serious quality issues while complying to various regulations.

As seen in this table where we are comparing both devices, one noticeable aspect is the battery. While ours is replicable and chargeable, Fridge-tag® 2 L's Battery is not and after 3 years a new device needs to replace the previous one, forcing the user to buy new devices every 3 years for the price of \$149.00. Other aspect is the display used to give the user any logs / data available. Our design will use an application that will display the log / data via Bluetooth while Fridge-tag® 2 L is using a custom LCD display. Like we previously said, our design specializes in the monitoring of insulin but this other product specializes in a variety of meds and vaccines that are temperature sensitive. A few examples are ALL vaccines, Victoza, Botox, Humira, Byetta and Caverject. Finally, one critical factor is that our design will be able to transfer data / log converted to PDF via Bluetooth using an app while this other design uses a USB port. Regarding logging and expiration dates in our design, it will be the responsibility of the main unit.
