\section{Market Description}
The market target of our system is the Fridge-tag® 2 L\cite{RefrigeratorTemperatureMonitoring}. This device is similar to the idea of our project, is a high precision temperature data logger but it focuses on the monitoring of sensitive vaccines and pharmaceuticals stored in medical refrigerators \& freezers. The Fridge-tag 2 L automatically triggers an alarm when a critical temperature deviation out of the predefined temperature range is measured. This enables to react just in time and avoid serious quality issues while complying to various regulations.

As seen in this table where we are comparing both devices, one noticeable aspect is the battery. While ours is replicable and chargeable, Fridge-tag® 2 L's Battery is not and after 3 years a new device needs to replace the previous one, forcing the user to buy new devices every 3 years for the price of \$149.00. Other aspect is the complexity of the LED display. Ours is a simple 3 Piece 7 Segment Display while Fridge-tag® 2 L's display is a more complex design. Another factor is that our design has no need to transfer data online considering that this design will be usable for situation where we don't have internet connection due blackouts.
