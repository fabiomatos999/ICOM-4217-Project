\chapter{Introduction}
In 2017 hurricane Maria devastated the northeastern Caribbean, particularly Dominica, Saint Croix, and Puerto Rico. In the wake of the storm, Puerto Rico suffered the longest blackout in US history and the second longest blackout in recorded human history [1]. The revised death count attributable to the hurricane was 2,975 people [2]. According to an investigation by the New York Times, deaths caused by  sepsis, pneumonia, emphysema, diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's spiked in the two months following the hurricane.[3]. The whole island of Puerto Rico was declared a disaster zone by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and it wasn't until four to eight months after the storm that most of the population had electricity and running water after the storm.
