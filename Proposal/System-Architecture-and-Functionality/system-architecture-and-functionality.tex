As shown above, this design will have two distinct units, the sub-units and a main unit.\\
The major software functions of this design will be:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Convert the output of the temperature sensor to temperature in Celsius.
        \item Check if there is mains power available.
        \item If mains power is available, use normal storage guidelines, else use emergency guidelines.
        \item Verify that the temperature meets the guidelines. If it does not meet the guidelines. Raise warning.
        \item Display the current temperature of the temperature sensor. If a warning is raised in the MCU display warning.
        \item If a warning is displayed accept input from button when pressed to clear status and recheck for compliance.
\end{enumerate}
