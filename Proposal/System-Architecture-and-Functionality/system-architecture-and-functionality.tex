\newpage
As shown above, this design will have two distinct units, the sub-units and a main unit.\\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Sub\-Unit:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Hold the current time and date, expiration date, and lot number.
          \item Check the current temperature.
          \item Verify if the temperature is meeting the guidelines.
          \item If the guidelines are not met, turn on an LED and send a warning
                to the main unit.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Main Unit:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Receive error signals from the sub-units.
          \item Keep inventory of the lots.
          \item Send log files either periodically or on demand to an
                application.
          \item Send warning notifications to an application if an error has
                occurred.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
The major software functions of this design will be:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sub-Unit:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Hold the current date and verify that is it less than the
                expiration date.
          \item If the current date is greater than expiration date, raise an
                error, send it to the main unit and turn on an LED.
          \item Verify that
                \textnormal{$2^{\circ}C < Current Temperature <= 8^{\circ}C$}.
                If not, turn on an LED and send a specific warning to the main
                unit following the current criteria\cite{ManagingInsulinEmergency2021}.
                \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textnormal{$Current Temperature \leq 0^{\circ}C$}
                  \item
                        \textnormal{$0^{\circ}C < Current Temperature \leq 2^{\circ}C$}
                  \item
                        \textnormal{$8^{\circ}C < Current Temperature \leq 15^{\circ}C$}
                  \item \textnormal{$Current Temperature > 15^{\circ}C$}
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
