My client is Glorianne Diaz-Qui√±ones (PharmD Candidate 2023) Email: glorianne.diaz@gmail.com Tel: 787\-346\-0704. She thought is was great idea because she has seen many patients (particularly elderly ones) that leave their insulin unrefrigerated by accident by leaving the insulin in the car after picking it up from the pharmacy or leaving the box of insulin them on the counter after taking a vial out. She also saw the benefit of having a device follow the storage guidelines for insulin in post-disaster conditions where access to the internet is limited.
