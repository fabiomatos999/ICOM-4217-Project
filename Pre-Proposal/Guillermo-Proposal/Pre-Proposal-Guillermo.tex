\chapter{Potential Project Description Guillermo}

The design in mind is using micro-processors to create a machine that is able to fold clothes after being washed just by placing them on top of it by using a foldable surface with small motors integrated for it to manage the correct foldable pattern. It will be able to detect what kind of cloth is by using infrared cameras or a similar technology and with this, it will be able to choose the correct pattern to fold the cloth.  This design could be useful in different settings but I would like to focus on situations were the user needs it because of a restriction that could be age, where doing repetitive actions could be tiring, or it can be used with people with certain medical conditions like fibromyalgia where moving their bodies becomes painful, specially when making pressure with their hands becomes difficult, or staying seated or standing for long periods of times causes pain. The need  and motivation that creates the problem is the fact that there are people out there that even when doing simple chores like this one, will have negative the consequences on their bodies. This design will be able to reduce those negative consequences. The problem being addressed is the difficulty for people with certain medical conditions when folding clothes and the solution scope in mind is an automatic process that folds the clothes for the users.
