\chapter {Humidity and Temperature sensor}

The proposal in mind is a integrated humidity and temperature sensor that provides high accuracy measurments for humidity levels like the amount of water vapor in the air. The humidity in industrial and home environments is critical to the long-term health and well-being of people or the up keep of the equipment of the industry involved. Humidity sensing and control is also important for the safety of equipment and employees. The need that creates the problem is that in there's a high humidity in Puerto Rico since its a tropical island thus this system would be very beneficial in health benefits and cost reduction by alerting the user and resolving the problem at the same time manually by an interactive system. The problem addressed is the humidity problem in warehouses and retail locations that damage documents around the place. The solution scope is the water vapor passes into a conductive electrode that water molecules in the air permeate the humidity sensing dielectric and this changes by the concentration of water and the integrated sensor measures the capacitance and coverts into digital data and also measures the temperature and outputs the information in $\normalfont{I^{2}C}$ inter-integrated controller and this runs on a battery bank that also has a USB-C port to do maintenance on the software.
