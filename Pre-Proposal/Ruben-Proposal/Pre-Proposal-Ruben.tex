\section {Potential Project Description Rubén}
The proposal in mind is a micro-processor or micro-controller humidity alert and purifier that uses controllers and sensors to funtion, if the humidity is over a certain amount this is activated or can be disabled by the user or change the detection level preferred by the user. The setting of the problem is which would be designed for almost any household or place that is vulnerable to high humidity that has use by users, this would help in the reporcusions of humidity since high humidity can cause fungus and bacterias to spread or just damage equipment that is vulnerable to high humidity like water damage and respiratory illnesses. This is very common in Puerto Rico thus this system would be very beneficial in health benefits and cost reduction by alerting the user and resolving the problem at the same time manually by an interative system or automated one.
