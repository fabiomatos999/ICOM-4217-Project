\section{Potential Project Description Enrique}
The potential project revolves around the sport airsoft. In airsoft, there are a few modes mainly played, being team deathmatch, capture the flag and king of the hill, with a few others. While these modes are fun, the mayority of matches is team deathmatch with one life, which can become boresome after a while. Because the majority of games are like this, most people who play wouldn't think different ways to play, since it's mostly take out the enemy team. There isn't really a good sense of needing to make a stratgey to defend a zone, where the other team may come from, or how to stop them. Not only this, but these require others to become referees in order to keep count of scores. For this, a new mode can be done called "Domination", which will be achieved with the help of micro-controllers. One micro-controller will be on the arm of the user, which we'll call a player, with a screen and sensor to determine if the player is capturing a point or if the point has been captured, while another will be set in a point, with a sensor, to let the other micro-controller determine if they are close enough to the point to capture it or let know the user the point has been captured by their team. With the same setup, an easier mode can done called "Capture the headquarters", where a team must defend a point while another team tries to capture it, but the attacking team cannot start to capture as long as there is a member of the defending team at the point. With these two modes, a better way to collect points can be made, and since the players will have screens on their wrists, they can see how much points their team is holding and let them determine what would be the next best course of action. This should be majorly used when there are airsoft events, so there are more interesting and challenging modes where players can change the way they play, how they think at the moment and also form a new plan depending on the situation.
