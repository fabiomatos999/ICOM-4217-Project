\begin{enumerate}
  \item Insulin Temperature Warning System
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Feasibility: It is very feasible given 4 month development cycle.
          \item Has it hardware and software opportunities? It both utilizes the hardware elements within a micro-controller and the flexability and decision making capabilities of a micro-controller to a large extent whilst needing to be low cost.
          \item Dependencies: The delivery of materials from component vendors.
          \item Required technologies: Micro-controller, temperature sensor, memory controller, segment display, rechargeable LIPO batteries, BMS and uninterruptable power supply.
          \item Cost: A rough estimate of the necesary components yielded a cost of \$35.
        \end{itemize}
