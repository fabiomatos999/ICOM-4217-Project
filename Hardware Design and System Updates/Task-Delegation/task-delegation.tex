\section{Delegation of Tasks}
For this proposal, the Insulin Temperature System modulerized into 3 separate parts, those being:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Main Unit
  \item Sub Unit
  \item PSU
\end{itemize}
The main unit consists of the MSP-EXP430FR2311 development board and the HM-10 BLE Bluetooth module. The sub unit consists of another MSP-EXP430FR2311, a HM-10 BLE Bluetooth module and an LED. The PSU consists of 2 individual parts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Main Unit PSU
  \item Sub unit PSU
\end{itemize}
The main unit consists of a 3.3\si{\V} power supply along with a 3.3\si{\V} voltage sense for a GPIO pin with a battery backup circuit.  The sub unit PSU consists of a 3.3\si{\V} regulated battery supply.\\
The following table demonstrates how the modules were distributed within the team:
